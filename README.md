# Add additional responsiveness
1. Background Images change every couple of seconds (create a slide show or an image carousel that automatically transitions images)
2. Have the 'Introducing The Box' section text and image slide and/or appear on the webpage when the user scrolls to that section.

3. When the Navbar reaches the top of the screen have it 'stick' to the top of the webpage
